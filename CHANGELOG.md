  * [Controller] `assign_status` is deprecated in favor of `put_status`

* Backwards incompatible changes

  * [Channel] Assign API for Sockets allows ephemeral state to be stored on the multiplexed socket, similar to conn assigns

* Bug fixes
  * Various bug fixes and improvements

* Backwards incompatible changes
  * [Config] ExConf Configuration has been replaced by Mix Config
  * Directory and naming conventions have changed. A `web/` directory now lives at root of the project and holds routers, controllers, channels, views & templates, where all `web/` files are recompiled by the code reloader during development. Modules that cannot be simply recompiled in process are placed in lib as normal and require a server restart to take effect. Follow [this guide](https://gist.github.com/dgoldie/2fdc90fe09ecdddb78f4) for upgrade steps from 0.3.x.
  * Naming conventions now use singular form for module names, directory names, and named route helpers
  * [Router] Named route helpers have been reworked to use single function name with pattern matched arguments. See the [readme  examples](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/0b6bdffab45fc46bc1455860f2d3971d0224eeb5/README.md#resources)
  * [Controller] `layout: nil` render option has been replaced by `assign_layout(conn, :none)`
  * [Plugs] `Plugs.JSON` now adds parsed params under "_json" key when the JSON object is an array

* Backwards incompatible changes

  * Channel and Topic `reply` and `broadcast` functions now require a map instead of an arbitrary dict
